Project Overview :

-> It's a healthcare project named CDR(clinical Data Repository) . 
-> It's a product developed by Nextgen basically it's an HIE(Health Information Exchange ) tool .
-> used by various medical agencies like hospitals ,doctors ,patients etc as per their need.
-> For hospitals whenever any patient goes to hospital they(hospital) verify the whether the patient is already registered with HIE .
-> If Not then they create that patient's data and If yes then they fetch the patient's data.
-> Communication/transfer of data isn't done with plain text but with set of international standards used to transfer and share data between various healthcare providers like HL7(Health Level 7) , CDA ,CCDA basically these are standard message formats used for comm. across the countries.
-> There are various source system via which we recive the mess most of them are processed through mirth connect ( which is a nextgen internal prod  , seprate teams are handling that)
-> We can also configure anther HIE system transfer the mess using Rest/Soap endpoints.
-> Traffic around 200/300 mess/min.
-> For each record(Patient data) we maintain audit(event and event type ) in case there is any change in patient data.

       
 Spring Mvc Framework .
  
 MConnect -> Load Balancer( Round Roin Schedullling) -> redirect to any server of  Results CDR ( 5 ) -> Once mess recieved in CDR request redirected to Appropriate controller -> data saved/fetched using hibernate 
			 
 After DML operation -> Creation/Updation event sent into Kafka Topic named as delivery eveluation -> Listeners are attached to this topic to confirm whether acknow needs to send out or not .
 
 Accordingly Ackn are sent.
